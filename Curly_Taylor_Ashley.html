<h1>Known to History as Curly the Crow Scout</h1> 
<h2>The enemy of my enemy</h2> 
<p> As a child the future Chief 
Plenty Coups had a vision that told the Crow that they as a tribe must 
support the rising American power or face destruction<p> </p> 
<h2>Custer's Scout</h2> 
<p> Curly represented the Crow tribe in their 
alliance with the US Army. Custer released all Crow scouts before the 
Battle of the Little Bighorn. It was Curly who brought news of the 7th 
Cavalry's defeat to US Forces </p>

<blockquote cite="https://genealogytrails.com/mon/bighorn/curlyindianscout.html"> 
<p> Howard Boggess, a descendant of one of Custer's scouts, lived in 
Hardin, about 20 miles north of the battlefield. His great-grandmother 
was Woman Who Walked into the Clouds. Her brother was Curly, the scout 
who according to some accounts survived by hiding in tall grass as men 
died around him. "He lived with the battle the rest of his life," 
Boggess says. "My mother said that every morning, Curly would get up 
early and ride the battlefield and sing chants for the people who 
died."  <p> </blockquote>
